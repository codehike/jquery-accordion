#jQuery Accordion

An "accordion" is UI widget that helps manage content on a web page by keeping it hidden until needed. The ideal content for an accordion will be a information divided into "headings" and "bodies". The headings are always shown but the bodies are hidden until the user selects the heading. 

Our accordion widget consists of an alternating `h3` and `div` elements, where the `h3` is used as a heading and the `div` is used as a body. By default, all `div` elements are collapsed. When the user clicks on a `h3` element, the `div` that immediately follows it will be expanded, while any other expanded `div` element will be collapsed.

We will use the `.slideUp()` and `.slideDown()` jQuery methods to create a smooth effect when the `div` elements are expanded and collapsed.
